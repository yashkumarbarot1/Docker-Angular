# Angular in a Docker Container
In this tutorial, we are going to take a close look at Docker and its containers.

We will discover, how we can use Docker to build and host a simple angular application.

For that, we will create a simple image to build angular and then use the Docker multi-stage feature to create another image to host our application using NGINX.

We will then learn how we can build our Docker image in a container using Docker itself and Docker-Compose.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have a angular application running in your own Docker container.
